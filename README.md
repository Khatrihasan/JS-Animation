# JS-Animation
Toggle Background, Shape, and Movement Animation
Features
1. Background Color Toggle: The box toggles between blueviolet and red when clicking the button.
2. Shape Change: The box alternates between a square and a circle.
3. Movement Animation: Smooth movement and scaling effects are applied when the shape toggles.
4. CSS Transitions: Smooth transitions enhance user experience for background, shape, and position changes.
How it Works
. A button click triggers a JavaScript function that toggles:
. Background color (red or blueviolet).
. Shape (circle with border-radius vs square).
. Movement (translateX with scaling using CSS).
. The CSS transition property ensures smooth animations.
Technologies Used
. HTML: Page structure.
. CSS: Styling and animations.
. JavaScript: Event handling for dynamic changes
